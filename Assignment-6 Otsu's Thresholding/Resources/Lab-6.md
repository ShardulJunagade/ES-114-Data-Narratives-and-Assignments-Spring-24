# Lab Assignment - 5

Implement Otsu's Threshold method for binarizing a given greyscale image with an intensity range of [0,255]. The output binary image should have only two intensity options, 0 and 1/255. Add Gaussian noise to the input greyscale image of varying variance and report the results. Sample implementations are available in the links attached. However, you need to write your code for this method.

Show the final results on the given dataset [https://iitgnacin-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/19210048_iitgn_ac_in/EQGIYSfTWplDiL4l891VnsMB0GAmKOh0lESGiXcBf3etBg?e=IFOkAF]
