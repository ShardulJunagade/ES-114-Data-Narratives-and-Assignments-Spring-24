# Lab Assignment - 9

Consider the IRIS dataset attached below. Load the dataset using the seaborn library function as per the attached link. There are 150 data points in this dataset and 3 different species.
1. Estimate the covariance matrix of the 4 attributes.

2. Estimate the four principal components of the data.

3. Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA to reduce 150 data points into two dimensions and three dimensions.

4. Visualize the reduced dimension 150 data points in 2D and 3D while giving different colors to reduced data points of diff different species.
