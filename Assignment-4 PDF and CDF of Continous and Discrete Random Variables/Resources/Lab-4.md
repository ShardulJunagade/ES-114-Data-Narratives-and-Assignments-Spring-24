# Lab Assignment - 4

Use Matplotlib or Seaborn libraries along with Numpy to achieve these tasks during the lab sessions on 13 and 16 Feb 2024.

1. Plot the Probability Density Functions (PDF) of the following Continuous Random Variables by varying the appropriate parameters taken as user input. Compare the plots of the same PDF plotted with different parameters. [1 Mark]

    a) Uniform

    b) Gaussian/Normal

    c) Exponential

    d) Cauchy

    e) Laplacian

    f) Rayleigh

2. Plot the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of each continuous random variable above by varying parameter values taken as user input if the closed form mathematical expression exists. [1 Mark]

3. Plot the CDF of each discrete random variable given in Lab Assignment 3 by varying parameter values taken as user input (No need to derive closed form expression in this case). [1 Mark]

4. Viva evaluation by the TA during the next lab session. [2 Marks]
