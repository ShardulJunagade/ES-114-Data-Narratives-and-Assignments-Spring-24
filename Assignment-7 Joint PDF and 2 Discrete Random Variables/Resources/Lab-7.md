# Lab Assignment - 7

a) Write a Python program to determine if a given Joint PMF corresponds to independent random variables (X,Y) or not. Take the range of values of random variables X and Y as the input and then take the Joint PMF as the input. Assume X and Y take finite number of values.

b) Plot the Joint PMF and the corresponding Joint CDF. Also, determine and plot the two Marginal PMFs and Marginal CDFs.

c) Determine the value of E[XY]. If X1=X-E[X] and Y1=Y-E[Y], determine E[X1Y1].
